<h1>The Colours and the Shapes</h1>
<p>
Hello visitor! I love colours and shapes.
In fact I love them so much I have created this gallery full of colours and shapes.
To not make it confusing I have divided them up into two pages: the colours and the shapes.
Please use the menu above to go and look at the colours and the shapes.
